Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program
Project Overview
This repository hosts the Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program developed for Southern New Hampshire University. The primary goal of this program is to track the frequency of item purchases at a grocery store to assist in inventory management and optimizing store layout.

Project Summary
The Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program provides a simple, console-based interface that allows users to:

Search for an item's purchase frequency.
Display a list of all items with their frequencies.
Visualize item frequencies through a histogram.
Exit the application safely.
This program leverages C++ for its development, emphasizing well-documented, readable, and efficient code that adheres to industry standards.

Reflections
What problem was the project solving?
This project addresses the need for effective inventory management at grocery stores by tracking item purchase frequencies, which aids in making informed decisions regarding stock levels and store layout optimizations.

What did I do particularly well?
I effectively implemented data handling using C++ standard library features, such as std::map, to organize and retrieve data efficiently. My approach to designing a user-friendly console menu was particularly successful, making the program accessible to users with no technical background.

Where could I enhance my code?
Enhancements could be made by integrating more sophisticated error handling to manage unexpected user inputs and file handling errors more gracefully. Improving these aspects would make the code more robust and secure against potential runtime errors.

Which pieces of the code were most challenging to write, and how did I overcome this?
Implementing the histogram display was challenging due to the need to dynamically adjust the visualization based on item frequency data. I overcame this by researching best practices in C++ for generating dynamic ASCII art and experimenting with different methods of scaling output based on input size.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
The skills in handling file I/O operations, data structure manipulation, and dynamic data visualization are highly transferable. These are essential skills for any software development project that involves data processing and user interaction.

How did I make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I:

Used clear naming conventions for functions and variables.
Implemented modular code with well-defined functions.
Documented the code thoroughly, including comments that explain the logic and purpose of each section.
Conclusion
The Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program is a testament to the utility of C++ in creating functional and user-friendly applications. This project not only helped in refining my coding skills but also in understanding how to effectively meet user needs through software solutions.
